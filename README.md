Build a Command Line Interface for getting information on GitHub users' accounts.

Gene Tinderholm

githuh, when run will first ask for an OAuth token. This token is stored locally in a plain text file (please remember to delete after grading).

valid syntax for the command line interface:

githuh <repos|stars|profile> <github username>

Both options are required.

Output is a list of repos/descriptions (for repos or stars options), or a list of profile charictaristics (for profile option).
